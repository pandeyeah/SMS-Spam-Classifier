**SMS Spam Classifier: Machine Learning Project**

**Description:**
SMS spam poses a significant nuisance to mobile users, inundating inboxes with unwanted messages. Our SMS spam classifier project addresses this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. By doing so, we aim to empower users to filter out unwanted content effectively.

**Features:**

Our project encompasses several key features:

1. **Dataset:** We utilize a publicly available dataset containing labeled SMS messages, comprising both spam and legitimate (ham) messages. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating our classifier.

2. **Preprocessing:** Prior to training, we preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and stemming to standardize the text format. Additionally, we explore techniques such as TF-IDF to transform the text into numerical features for model training.

3. **Model Selection:** We experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM, CNN). Each algorithm undergoes rigorous evaluation based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective model for spam classification.

4. **Model Training:** The chosen algorithm is trained on a portion of the dataset, utilizing techniques like cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and mitigate overfitting.

5. **Evaluation:** We assess the performance of the trained model on a separate test set, employing techniques such as confusion matrices and ROC curves for visualization. This allows us to gain insights into the classifier's strengths and weaknesses.

6. **Deployment:** Upon achieving satisfactory performance, we deploy the trained model into a practical application or web service. This enables users to input text messages and receive real-time predictions regarding their spam status.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the documentation to set up the environment and install dependencies.
3. Run preprocessing scripts to clean and transform the data.
4. Choose a machine learning algorithm and train the model using provided scripts or notebooks.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics scripts.
6. Deploy the classifier as per deployment instructions for real-world usage.
